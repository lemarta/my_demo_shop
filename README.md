# My Demo Shop

This project mostly resolves around payment processing using 3rd party payment processor and dynamic invoicing.

Please set up new virtualenv and install packages from requirements.txt.

Running this project will require opening up a test account with Stripe to obtain test API keys. Additionally, a tunnel between localhost and Stripe must be open, to listen to feedback from Stripe. This can be done through Stripe's own CLI or for example ngrok. Personally I used Stripe CLI and the information on homepage refer to that.

Detailed instructions and description are available on the homepage of the project.
